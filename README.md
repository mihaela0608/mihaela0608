### 💬 About Me

Hey! I'm Mihaela — I just finished high school and I’m jumping into Software Engineering with plenty of curiosity and zero fear of bugs.

I learned to code thanks to **SoftUni**, a few awesome YouTube creators, and countless debugging battles. I like building things that *actually matter* — useful, smart, and sometimes a bit unexpected.

I believe code should do more than just run — it should solve real problems. Whether it’s organizing events, supporting athletes, or making life just a bit easier, I aim to create apps that feel human.

### 🔧 Tech Stack

- Java, Spring Boot, MySQL  
- HTML/CSS, Thymeleaf  
- JavaScript (comfortable with basics, eager to improve)
- Docker (learning and experimenting)

### 🚀 Projects I'm Working On

**🎽 IronTrack**  
A triathlon training app built for athletes who focus more on effort than equipment.  
No GPS, no smartwatch — just you, your goals, and a coach who believes in you.

**🎉 Eventure**  
A clean and welcoming platform where users can attend or apply to host events.  
Organizers go through a short application, and admins keep things smooth.

**🧪 Upcoming Ideas**
- REST API project with a real-world purpose  
- Tools for smarter, greener homes and cities

### ✨ A Few Things About Me

- I value faith above all, followed by family and purpose — these guide how I live and code.
- Training for triathlons has taught me discipline and resilience, while cooking keeps my creativity sharp.
- Folk dancing is part of my roots — a reminder that teamwork and culture matter, even off the clock.

P.S. If it has a database, an API, and a dream behind it — I probably already want to build it.
